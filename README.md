reRPC
=====

[![Build](https://github.com/rerpc/rerpc/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/rerpc/rerpc/actions/workflows/test.yml)[![GoDoc](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/rerpc/rerpc.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/rerpc/rerpc)

reRPC is a small RPC framework built on [protocol buffers][protobuf] and
`net/http`. It generates code from API definition files so you can focus on
your application logic: no more artisanal query parameter parsing, no more
debates between PUT and PATCH, and no more hand-written clients.

reRPC servers and clients use [gRPC's][grpc] HTTP/2 protocol. reRPC servers
work seamlessly with clients generated by [any gRPC
implementation][grpc-implementations], command-line tools like [grpcurl][], and
proxies like [gRPC-Gateway][grpc-gateway] and [Envoy][envoy]. Similarly, reRPC
clients can call any gRPC server.

reRPC servers also support [Twirp's][twirp] HTTP/1.1 protocol. Of course,
clients generated by [any Twirp implementation][twirp-implementations] work
with reRPC servers. More importantly, Twirp's JSON variant is perfect for
debugging with cURL.

For more on reRPC, including a walkthrough and comparison to alternatives, see
the [docs][].

## A Small Example

Curious what all this looks like in practice? Here's a small h2c server:

```go
package main

import (
  "net/http"

  "golang.org/x/net/http2"
  "golang.org/x/net/http2/h2c"

  pingpb "github.com/rerpc/rerpc/internal/ping/v1test" // generated
)

type PingServer struct {
  pingpb.UnimplementedPingServiceReRPC // returns errors from all methods
}

func main() {
  ping := &PingServer{}
  mux := http.NewServeMux()
  mux.Handle(pingpb.NewPingHandlerReRPC(ping))
  handler := h2c.NewHandler(mux, &http2.Server{})
  http.ListenAndServe(":8081", handler)
}
```

With that server running, you can make requests with a gRPC client or with
cURL:

```bash
$ curl --request POST \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  http://localhost:8081/internal.ping.v1test.PingService/Ping

{"code":"unimplemented","msg":"internal.ping.v1test.PingService.Ping isn't implemented"}
```

You can find production-ready examples of [servers][prod-server] and
[clients][prod-client] in the API documentation.

## Status

This is the earliest of early alphas: APIs *will* break before the first stable
release.

## Support and Versioning

reRPC supports:

* The [two most recent major releases][go-support-policy] of Go.
* Version 3 of the protocol buffer language ([proto3][]).
* [APIv2][] of protocol buffers in Go (`google.golang.org/protobuf`).

Within those parameters, reRPC follows semantic versioning.
