// Package rerpc is a small RPC framework built on protocol buffers and
// net/http. It's wire-compatible with gRPC and Twirp.
//
// This documentation is intended to explain each type and function in
// isolation. For walkthroughs, comparisons to grpc-go and Twirp, and other
// narrative docs, see the project wiki:
// https://github.com/akshayjshah/rerpc/wiki.
